/**
 * ThreadTracingRunnable tries to help debugging crashes happening across threads showing the
 * stacktrace of the crash origin which scheduled this runnable.
 *
 * <p>A stacktrace, together with the origin thread name, is going to be "saved" at the time this
 * class is instantiated and appended as "cause" to whatever is thrown from the {@link #run()}
 * method.
 *
 * <p>To use this class, just extends it instead of implementing {@link Runnable}. Then just
 * implement {@link #tracedRun(ThreadTracingRunnable)}.
 *
 * <p>If the runnable is created ahead of time and used somewhere else later, a new, more relevant,
 * stacktrace can be created calling {@link #resetTrace()}.
 *
 * <p>If you need to chain another Runnable from your run method, you can pass the Throwable
 * parameter from {@link #tracedRun(ThreadTracingRunnable)} to the constructor {@link
 * ThreadTracingRunnable#tracedRun(ThreadTracingRunnable)}. Therefore, the crash can now be tracked
 * across boundaries of multiple threads.
